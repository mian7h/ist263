                I am an Information Management and Technology major interested in information security.
                I am taking this class, as well as the beginners Python class—IST 256—this semester. During my free time, I like to go to the gym, run, watch TikToks, and learn about religion. I am a <strong>first-generation college student</strong> and am excited to see where life takes me after graduation. I hope to be a better web developer after this class. Perhaps I will be more comfortable in coding. I am currently craving Moroccan Mint Tea.

    <h1>Narrow-body Planes</h1>
    <h2>Narrow-body planes, or single-aisle aircraft, are types of planes that tend to have a smaller fuselage and single passenger aisle. These aircraft are designed for shorter to medium-range flights and tend to be a common choice for domestic routes.</h2> <br>
    <p>Notable Narrow-Body Plane Manufacturers:<br>
        Boeing: Boeing produces many narrow-body planes, including the Boeing 737 (a model narrow-body for airlines worldwide. It is renowned for its reliability and versatility).<br>
        Airbus: Airbus manufactures the A320 family of narrow-body aircraft, including the A318, A319, A320, and A321. (each respective model design just gets narrower). These planes are often known for fuel efficiency.<br>

        Features of Narrow-Body Planes:<br>
        Efficiency: Narrow-body planes are usually fuel-efficient. As a result, this means they are cost-effective for shorter routes. Due to their size, they are also versatile and can access airports with smaller runways.<br>
        Passenger Capacity: Even though the design is narrow, the airliners are still able to carry a large number of passengers in a single aisle design.<br>
        Historical Significance: Historically, Narrow-body planes have been developed in the mid to late 1950â€™s with the help of Boeing with the 707. Regardless, these airliners have been a pinnacle in terms of regional and domestic travel. It facilitates convenient air travel for passengers and has advanced throughout the years in terms of technology, efficiency, safety, and passenger comfort.<br>
